# Cocktail Mixer App

https://my-drink-list.vercel.app/

The Cocktail Mixer App is a web application that helps users discover cocktails based on their preferred ingredients or by randomly suggesting a cocktail. Users can input two ingredients to find a list of cocktails that include those ingredients, or they can opt to receive a random cocktail recommendation.

## Features

- **Ingredient Search:** Users can input two ingredients to find a list of cocktails that contain those ingredients.
- **Random Cocktail:** Users can get a random cocktail recommendation with the click of a button.
- **Cocktail Details:** Each cocktail displayed includes its name, image, instructions, and a list of ingredients.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** The front-end of the application is built using React.js to create a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **API Integration:** The app integrates with [TheCocktailDB API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php) to fetch cocktail data and details.
- **CSS:** Styling and layout are implemented using CSS for an enhanced user experience.

## Usage

To use the Cocktail Mixer App:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
